            <p>
                I’ve always been fascinated by programming because behind every seemingly simple task, the code is
                always super logical and meticulous, since one missing semicolon can lead to a syntax error and one
                miscalculation can lead to a logic error. Additionally, problem sets only provide test cases of inputs
                and corresponding outputs, which means the possibilities are endless.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first experience with programming was when I took the AP CSA class in my sophomore year of high
                school. Although the concepts of how programming worked weren’t hard to grasp, I could not understand
                the logic behind how to write programs. I knew how conditionals and loops work and I knew how to code
                trace, but I had no idea how to utilize those concepts to write programs that can solve problem sets. So
                when the AP exam rolled around, I completely blanked out during the free response section. I could not
                answer a single free response question because I didn’t even understand what they were asking me to do.
                It was the first time I’ve ever felt defeated while taking a test, but on the other hand, it motivated
                me to do better than my score.
